# Roblox Scripting Portfolio

Welcome to my Roblox scripting portfolio!  
Here are some examples of the Lua systems Iâ€™ve created for Roblox games over the past 3 years.  

## ðŸš€ Highlights
- **DataStore System** â€“ Reliable player data saving/loading.  
- **Shop & Inventory Systems** â€“ Supports Gamepasses, Developer Products, and GUIs.  
- **Leaderboards** â€“ Tracks player stats & displays in-game rankings.  
- **Remote Communication** â€“ Secure client-server interaction with RemoteEvents/RemoteFunctions.  

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `DataStore.lua` â†’ Player saving/loading  
- `ShopSystem.lua` â†’ In-game purchases  
- `InventorySystem.lua` â†’ Inventory management  
- `Leaderboard.lua` â†’ Player stats leaderboard
